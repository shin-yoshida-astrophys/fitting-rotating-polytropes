Giving a simple functional relation between the rotational frequency and
the deformation for compressible stellar models is useful both in observational
and theoretical astrophysics.
Here I present simple formulae for the rotational frequency of polytropic
stars as a function of the oblateness, which is valid for a different polytropic
index in $1\le N\le 3$ and the speed of rotation up to the mass-shedding limit.

\section{} 

In \cite{Yoshida}, I presented assessment of the Roche
and the Darwin-Radau approximation which are often used in studying
rotating stars. Here I report a simple formula of a dimensionless stellar
angular frequency $\omega$ as a function of its oblateness, which
is derived by fitting numerical hydrostatic equilibria for a range of
polytropic equation of state (EOS).


The equilibrium models are computed by a numerical code for 
rotating hydrostatic two-dimensional equilibria.
The code is written by the author and tested against the existing
results \citep{HSCF}. The code self-consistently takes into account
the inhomogeneous gas distribution and its self-gravity. The assumption
of slow-rotation is not necessary and the models up to the mass-shedding
limit are obtained.

I focus on the property of rotating polytropes whose EOS is
\begin{equation}
	p = K \rho^{1+\frac{1}{N}},
\end{equation}
where $p$ and $\rho$ are the pressure and the density. $K$ is a constant
and $N$ is a constant called polytropic index. 

Given $N$, the rotational angular frequency $\omega$ normalized by the factor $\sqrt{GM/R_e^3}$
is fitted, where $M$ is the mass and $R_e$ is the equatorial radius. As for the independent
parameter, the normalized oblateness, $f_{\rm obl}/f_{\rm obl, MS}\equiv\tilde{f}_o$, is chosen,
where $f_{\rm obl} = 1-R_p/R_e$ and $R_p$ is the polar radius or the object.
Notice that $0\le \tilde{f}_o \le 1$.
$f_{\rm obl, MS}$ is the oblateness at the mass-shedding limit for the $N$ value.
The oblateness at the mass-shedding limit depends on the EOS. Thus I also
make a fitting formula of $f_{\rm obs, MS} (\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma = 1+1/N$.

Assumed functional form of the fitting formula of $\omega^2$ is the Pad\`{e} form,
\begin{equation}
	\omega^2(\tilde{f}_o) = \frac{\tilde{f}_o (a_0 + a_1 \tilde{f}_o)}{1 + a_2 \tilde{f}_o}
	\label{eq:omega2}
\end{equation}
and that of $f_{\rm obl, MS}$ as,
\begin{equation}
	f_{\rm obl, MS}(\Gamma) = \frac{b_0 + b_1 \Gamma}{1 + b_2 \Gamma}
	\label{eq:foblMS}
\end{equation}

I use the nonlinear least square fitting module of {\tt scipy.optimize.curve\_fit}
to fit the numerical data.
\footnote{\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html}
}
For the fitting of Eq.(\ref{eq:omega2}), I compute 694
models of polytropes with $N=(1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.5, 3.0)$
from non-rotating to maximally rotating (mass-shedding) cases.

The left panel of Fig.\ref{fig:1} shows the fitting of the $\omega^2$ data with an analytic 
form. All the data of different $N$ is weighted equally in the fitting. It is seen that the
simple form of Eq.(\ref{eq:omega2}) approximates the numerical data
within a few percent of errors, though the error increases steeply
as the model approaches the mass-shedding limit.
The right panel of Fig.\ref{fig:1} is $f_{\rm MS}$ and its fitting curve.


The fitting parameters obtained for $\omega^2$ are,
\begin{equation}
	a_0 = 0.6042, ~a_1=-0.07372, ~a_2=-0.4891, 
\end{equation}
and for $f_{\rm MS}$ are,
\begin{equation}
	b_0=0.1820,~ b_1=0.05912,~ b_2=-0.1619.
\end{equation}

are numerical data and the solid black line is the fitted formula by Eq.(\ref{eq:omega2}).
The dashed line is the curve for the incompressible Maclaurin spheroid \citep{Chandrasekhar}
in our normalization  (for which $f_{\rm obl, MS}=1$) .
The bottom panel shows the relative residuals (in percent) of the fitting. Notice that the
large residual for $\tilde{f}_o\to 0$ is an artifact of the behavior of $\omega^2\to 0$. 
Right: The oblateness at the mass-shedding limit

the solid black line is the fitted formula by Eq.(\ref{eq:foblMS}).

Alternatively, if a simple polynomial form,
\begin{equation}
	\omega^2 = \tilde{f}_0\sum_{j=0}p_j \tilde{f}_o^j,
\end{equation}
is chosen, a fitting with the minimal number of terms 
is done in a similar size of the error with,
\begin{equation}
	p_0=0.6020,~ p_1=0.2655,~ p_2=-0.04464,~ p_3=0.2148.
\end{equation}
